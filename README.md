# StreamLinesHPC
Final Project for CS5030 High Performance Computing which computes streamlines given a vector field by a fourth order rugga kutta method.
There is an implementation in MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA. See the PDF in the Final Folder for info on each implementation and a scaling study. The
python code can be used to generate a file which Paraview can use to generate a visualization of the streamlines.
